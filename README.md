# Turtle Street Crossing Game
This is a simple game where the player has to cross the street avoiding the cars. It was made using the Turtle module from Python's standard library.

## Requirements
To run the program, you'll need Python 3.9 or above to avoid any errors related to Type Hints from PEP 585. To start, download or clone the repository, and navigate to the project directory

```
cd BaseConversion
```

and run:

```
python main.py
```

## How to play
The turtle is only able to move upwards using the up arrow key. The goal is to cross the street without getting hit by a car. If the turtle gets hit, the game is over. If the turtle reaches the other side of the street, the players moves to the next level.
